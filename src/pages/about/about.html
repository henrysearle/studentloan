  <h1>Student Loan Calculator</h1>
  <p>
    The world of student loans is complicated because there are so many different rules, and factors that play into your
    loan. Knowing how much your loan will be, how much interest you will pay and how long it will take to pay it back.
  </p>
  <p>
    This calculator is designed to help you understand how much your loan will be, how much interest you will pay, and
    how long it will take to pay back.
  </p>

  <p>

    We used the following resources to build this calculator:<br/>
    Government Resources - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan/overview" target="_blank">gov.uk</a><br/>
    Student Loans Company - <a href="http://media.slc.co.uk/repayment/qsg/how-much-do-i-repay.html#s2-5" target="_blank">slc.co.uk</a><br/>

  </p>

  <p>
    Some values have been estimated, for instance, RPI and maintenance loan amounts.

  <h2>What I would do next</h2>
  <p>
    This tools is primarily meant for education around how long it will take you to pay back your student loan, which
    is primarily based on the salary you earn once you graduate. As the calculations are so complex, the best way
    to go about this is to show examples, which is what I have tried to do so far.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, I would make it possible to choose more information about the salary you will have once you have graduated and
    how that will increase over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    After that, I would look at different factors like those suggested in the brief, like the gender pay gap, time out
    for maternity leave and how long it takes to find work after university.
